This webapps allows churches to post weekly sermon notes to a mobile optimized web-page. When users enter notes on their smartphones, and click the submit button after providing and email address, the user receives the notes that they have completed in their inbox.

This project includes the admin tools for creating the sermon note pages, as well as the engine to process the completed web-notes and email them to the user.

An example of a church who has used this webapp since 2013 [can be found here:](http://connect.westheights.org/)

## History
2011 V1 - Writen in python. Served off a home computer during church. I had a flip-phone and a cell-phone plan that charged me 10cents a page for every page-visit.
2011/12 V2/V3 - Rewritten in PHP so that it could be served on the church's infrastructure. 
2013 and beyond - Some changes and updates, including style updates. Many of these updates are not captured here, but if you see something you like, I can pull reproduce it and commit it here for you.
